Brick Breaker Game
Welcome to the Brick Breaker Game, a Java implementation that brings the classic brick-breaking excitement to your fingertips. This game involves breaking bricks with a bouncing ball controlled by a paddle. Below, you'll find a detailed breakdown of the game's key components and features.

Key Components:
Classes & Objects
AuthenticationSystem:

Manages user registration, login, and authentication.
Game:

Main class that handles the game loop, user interactions, and menu.
Gameplay:

Implements the actual gameplay, including the paddle, ball, and brick interactions.
MapGenerator:

Generates the layout of bricks for the game.
Inheritance
The Admin class inherits from the User class, representing an admin user with extended functionalities.
Constructors
Constructors are present in classes like AuthenticationSystem, Gameplay, and others, initializing necessary components during object creation.
Overloading Method
The getUserInfo method in the User class is overloaded to provide different representations.
Overriding Method
The performSpecialAction method is overridden in both User and Admin classes.
Polymorphism
Achieved through method overriding and overloading, enabling flexibility in handling users and admins. Casting is done implicitly when checking if a user is an instance of Admin.
Encapsulation
Access modifiers like private, protected, and public are used to encapsulate the fields of the classes, controlling access to the data.
Abstraction
Achieved through the MapDrawable interface, providing a blueprint for drawing maps in the game.
Exception Handling
Exceptions are handled using try-catch blocks in the AuthenticationSystem and Game classes, ensuring smooth error handling during user interactions.
File I/O
The AuthenticationSystem class uses file I/O to save and load user information from a file.
Lambda Expression
Lambda expressions are utilized with the AuthenticationInterface interface in the AuthenticationSystem class for a concise implementation of file loading and saving operations.
Static Method
The initializeGame method in the Gameplay class is static, allowing for the initialization of the game without creating an instance of the class.
This Brick Breaker Game is a testament to various fundamental programming concepts and best practices. Explore and contribute to enhance the gaming experience. Let the fun begin! ðŸŽ®ðŸ§±
